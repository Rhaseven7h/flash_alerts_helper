FlashAlerts
===========

Adds an easy to use helper to include flash alerts to your rails app.


Example
=======

Add

<%= flash_alerts %>

In your rails app layout, and that's all, if there are messages in flash object they will
be rendered like this:

<div id='flash_message_box'>
    <div class='flash_message' id='flash_error'>
        Error Flash Message
    </div>
    <div class='flash_message' id='flash_notice'>
        Notice Flash Message
    </div>
</div>

So you can CSS-style it to your hearts content.

Not the plugin the world was waiting for, but I found my self doing this over and over,
I thought it would make a nice tiny plug in.
